# Mini Projects / Tools
Various python scripts I've written to accomplish niche tasks. Or random other things.

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| twitter_archive_image_renamer.py | Mass copies and renames Twitter archive media files (such as those found under `(your archive)\data\tweets_media`) to match their respective Tweet timestamps in `yyyymmdd_hhmmss` format. Should be used in a folder with only Twitter archive media files. ![Before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/962613703864356864/1065860114931789834/image.png) ![After](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/962613703864356864/1065860797735116870/image.png) |
| filename-metadata_converter.py | Mass edits image date metadata to match timestamp filenames that follow the `yyyymmdd_hhmmss` format. Only works on JPEG or TIFF files (files that support EXIF). Requires the [piexif](https://pypi.org/project/piexif/) Python package. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/962613703864356864/1065866923071512646/image.png) |
| Employee_Instructional_Prompt.py | Based on program seen on Stanley's work computer screen during The Stanley Parable's opening cutscene. Now YOU can press buttons just like Stanley! ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/962613703864356864/1065873174325104660/image.png) |
